//1. print1To255: Print all integers from 1 to 255.
//2. printOdds1To255: Print all the odd integers from 1 to 255.
//3. printIntsAndSum1To255: Print integers from 0 to 255 and the running sum.
// FOR ARRAYS make the array and pass it as an argument to this function!
//4. printArrayVals: Print all the value in a given array --
//5. printMaxOfArray: Print the largest element of an array.
//6. printAverageOfArray: Print the average of all the elements value of an array.
//7. returnOddsArray1to255: Return an aray with just the odd integers from 1-255.
//8. squareArrayVals: Given an array, square each value in the array.
//9.  returnCountOfElementsWithValueGreaterThanY: pass to arguments to the function, the array and y.  Return the number of elements in the array with a value greater than y.
//10.  setNegativeValuesOfArrayToZero: Set all of the negative values in an array to zero and return the array.
//11. printMaxMinAverageArrayVals:  given an array, print the min, max and average values of that array.
//12. shiftArrayValsLeft:  Given an array, move all of the values of the array to the left, removing element 0, and having the new last element of the array be zero.
//13. swapStringForNegativeValues:  Pass an array and a string into the function.  Replace all of the negative values with that string and return the array.
